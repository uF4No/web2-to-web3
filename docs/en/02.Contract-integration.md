# Integrating the Messages Smart Contract with React

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for integrating the `Messages` smart contract with your React application. It continues from where [01.Smart-contract.md](./01.Smart-contract.md) left off after deploying your contract using Remix IDE, and assumes you've already scaffolded your React project as described in [00.Scaffold-react-project.md](./00.Scaffold-react-project.md).

## Prerequisites

- Smart contract deployed to ZKsync Sepolia Testnet using Remix IDE (as detailed in the [previous guide](./01.Smart-contract.md))
- Contract address and ABI from your Remix deployment
- React application already scaffolded with Wagmi/Viem (as detailed in [00.Scaffold-react-project.md](./00.Scaffold-react-project.md))

## 1. Collect Contract Deployment Information

If you followed [01.Smart-contract.md](./01.Smart-contract.md), you should have:

- Your contract address from the Remix IDE deployment
- The contract ABI from the Remix compiler tab

Keep these handy as we'll need them for the React integration.

If you deployed to ZKsync Sepolia Testnet, you can verify your contract on the [ZKsync Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/) by searching for your contract address.

## 2. Update Network Configuration in wagmi.ts

Since your project was already scaffolded with wagmi, you just need to update the `src/wagmi.ts` file to ensure it includes ZKsync Sepolia Testnet:

[View the full code in src/wagmi.ts](../../src/wagmi.ts)

Key points:
- Import both `sepolia` and `zksyncSepoliaTestnet` chains
- Configure the Wagmi client to use these chains
- Set up the injected connector (MetaMask)

## 3. Add Contract ABI to Your Project

Create a new directory for contract artifacts:

```bash
mkdir -p src/contracts
```

Then create a file `src/contracts/messagesABI.ts` to store your contract ABI:

[View the full code in src/contracts/messagesABI.ts](../../src/contracts/messagesABI.ts)

Key points:
- Export the ABI as a const array
- Include all events and functions from your contract

## 4. Create a Contract Configuration

Create a file to store contract configuration at `src/contracts/messagesContract.ts`:

[View the full code in src/contracts/messagesContract.ts](../../src/contracts/messagesContract.ts)

Key points:
- Import the ABI from messagesABI.ts
- Define the contract address and ABI in an object

> **Important**: Make sure to replace the address with your actual deployed contract address from Remix. This is the address you received after deploying the contract in the previous guide.

## 5. Create React Hooks for Interacting with the Contract

Create a new directory for hooks:

```bash
mkdir -p src/hooks
```

Then create a file `src/hooks/useMessages.ts`:

[View the full code in src/hooks/useMessages.ts](../../src/hooks/useMessages.ts)

Key points:
- Define a Message interface for TypeScript type safety
- Use Wagmi hooks for reading and writing to the contract
- Implement functions to load messages in batches
- Add a function to send new messages
- Set up event watching for real-time updates

## 6. Create MessageList Component and Update App Component

Create a new directory for components if it doesn't exist already:

```bash
mkdir -p src/components
```

Then create a component to display the messages in a Twitter-like feed in `src/components/MessageList.tsx`:

[View the full code in src/components/MessageList.tsx](../../src/components/MessageList.tsx)

Key points:
- Use the useMessages hook to access messages and functions
- Implement a form to send new messages
- Display messages in a feed with newest first
- Add infinite scrolling via a scroll handler
- Include loading indicators and "load more" functionality

Now update `src/App.tsx` to include the MessageList component:

[View the full code in src/App.tsx](../../src/App.tsx)

Key points:
- Use Wagmi hooks for wallet connection
- Display wallet connection UI
- Conditionally render the MessageList when connected
- Show appropriate connection status and errors

## 7. Add CSS for Styling (Important)

The styling is essential to create a Twitter-like feed. Create or replace the content of `src/index.css`:

[View the full CSS in src/index.css](../../src/index.css)

This CSS provides styling for:
- Full-page consistent light background
- The app container and header
- Wallet connection buttons and status
- Message list and individual messages
- Input form with a light background and focus state
- Status and error messages

> **Note**: The styling ensures that the background color extends to the full height of the screen and that the input field has a light background for better readability.

## 8. Testing the Integration

1. Make sure your MetaMask wallet is connected to ZKsync Sepolia Testnet
   - Network Name: ZKsync Sepolia Testnet
   - RPC URL: https://sepolia.era.zksync.dev
   - Chain ID: 300
   - Currency Symbol: ETH
   
2. Ensure your contract address is correctly set in `src/contracts/messagesContract.ts`

3. Start your React app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Connect your wallet (the same one you used for deploying the contract in Remix)

5. Test sending and receiving messages:
   - Send a new message
   - Verify it appears in the message list
   - Try loading older messages via the "Load More" button or scrolling

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Gas Estimation Failed**: Make sure your contract is properly deployed to ZKsync Sepolia and the ABI matches exactly
- **Transaction Failed**: Check if you have enough ETH on ZKsync Sepolia to pay for gas
- **Contract Not Found**: Verify that the contract address in your configuration matches the one deployed from Remix
- **MetaMask Network Issues**: Ensure MetaMask is properly configured for ZKsync Sepolia Testnet
- **Pagination Issues**: Double-check the offset calculation in the loadMoreMessages function

## Next Steps

- Add message editing or deletion functionality (requires contract updates)
- Implement user profiles or message reactions
- Add message filtering or search functionality
- Implement end-to-end encryption for private messaging 
- Deploy your contract to ZKsync mainnet for production use
